They generally do not change form based on the subject (e.g., no -s for third person singular).",examples:["Can / Could: ability, possibility, permission (e.g., I can swim, Could you help me?)","May / Might: possibility, permission (e.g., It may rain, You might be right)","Will / Would: future, willingness, requests (e.g., I will go, Would you open the door?)","Shall / Should: obligation, advice, suggestion (e.g., We shall overcome, You should eat more vegetables)","Must: strong obligation, certainty (e.g., You must follow the rules, It must be true)","Ought to: moral obligation, advice (e.g., You ought to apologize)"]},{title:"Rules for Using Modal Verbs",description:"Modal verbs follow specific grammatical rules:",examples:["1. They are always followed by the base form of the main verb (infinitive without 'to'). (e.g., 'He can run', not 'He can to run' or 'He can runs')","2. They do not take '-s' in the third person singular. (e.g., 'She must go', not 'She musts go')","3. They form questions by inverting with the subject. (e.g., 'Can you hear me?', not 'Do you can hear me?')","4. They form negatives by adding 'not' after the modal verb. (e.g., 'I cannot wait', not 'I don't can wait')","5. They cannot be used with other auxiliary verbs like 'do' or 'does' for questions or negatives.","6. Some modals (like 'could', 'would', 'might') can refer to past, present, or future contexts depending on the sentence."]},{title:"Expressing Different Functions with Modals",description:"Modal verbs are versatile and can express a range of functions depending on the context.",examples:["Ability: I can speak French. / She could play the piano when she was young.","Permission: May I come in? / You can leave now.","Obligation/Necessity: We must wear masks. / You should apologize.","Possibility/Probability: It might snow tomorrow. / He could be at home.","Advice/Suggestion: You should see a doctor. / We could try that restaurant.","Prohibition: You must not smoke here. / You cannot park here."]},{title:"Semi-Modals (Modal-like Expressions)",description:"Some expressions function similarly to modal verbs, expressing similar meanings but following different grammatical rules, often requiring 'to' before the main verb.",examples:["Have to: obligation (e.g., I have to work tomorrow)","Be able to: ability (e.g., She is able to swim)","Ought to: advice/obligation (e.g., You ought to try)","Used to: past habit (e.g., I used to live there)","Need to: necessity (e.g., You need to listen)"]}]}}),1141,[]);
